I’m interested in integrating multi-view sequencing data with cutting-edge deep learning models to facilitate the development of new diagnosis and treatment strategies.
<!-- In terms of cancer diagnosis, I would focus on the analysis of cell free DNA and present a pan-cancer model that integrates multiple types of sequencing data obtained from the blood. As for cancer treatment, I am intrigued by the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data and will apply graphical model to leverage the spatial information and identify therapeutic targets and mechanisms that would help to develop new treatment strategies. -->
